    <P>
        Education helps in the mental and intellectual nourishment and growth of a person. Without education an
        individual cannot progress intellectually, and cannot develop skills and capacities to work. Education fosters
        the enlightenment, empowerment and emancipation of society </P>
    <li><H2><font color="orange">HOBBIES:</H2></font></li>
    <P>Writing and reading boost my imagination. Along with these activities, I participate in gardening in my leisure
        time because I love to plant new and colourful flowers. Moreover, I like listening stories n play online-games . These are the
        activities I often do whenever I find time after completing my studies and homework.
    </p>
    <li><H2><font color="purple">CAREER AMBITIONS</H2></font></li>
    <P> My life aspirations are to continue to gain more knowledge and excel in a career where I can be financially
        stable. I love learning; I love it when I learn something in one class and I am able to connect it to the
        concepts in another class or apply it to life in general. To me, learning is a lifelong process.</P>
